&lt;h2 id=&#34;unraveling-the-role-of-evolutionary-history-on-skin-and-gut-microbial-communities-of-anuran-amphibians&#34;&gt;Unraveling the Role of Evolutionary History on Skin and Gut Microbial Communities of Anuran Amphibians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am investigating how skin and gut microbial communities of amphibians relate to their evolutionary history. I sampled anuran amphibians in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and found that evolutionary history explains most the variation of their skin microbiome but almost nothing of the variation in the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am very interested in other topics such as community phylogenetics, conservation and disease ecology, topics that I mainly develop in collaboration with other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am collaborating with &lt;a href=&#34;http://lschiesari.wixsite.com/ecologia-aplicada&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Luis Schiesari&lt;/a&gt; in one project exploring the effects of land use change on aquatic metacommunities and another project on the metacommunity structure of rock pools. I am also working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://drdz.wp.txstate.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. David Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; and his group on the distribution and genetics of &lt;em&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/em&gt; in Texas and with &lt;a href=&#34;https://bolnicklab.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Daniel Bolnick&lt;/a&gt; and his group on parasite infection and threespine stickleback gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tadpole microbiome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of my Ph.D. research is with tadpole gut microbiome. At the amphibian community level, I am exploring the relative roles of regional (pond) and local (individual) effects on the gut microbiome of tadpoles (and some salamander larvae) in Brazil and East Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also testing the stability of the tadpole gut microbiome and how it relates to their diet. Tadpole diet is still an unresolved topic, and I am approaching that with new tools such as metabarcoding and stable isotope fingerprinting. Lastly, I am investigating the interplay between diet and microbiome on the performance of tadpoles.&lt;/p&gt;
