I am very interested in other topics such as community phylogenetics, conservation and disease ecology, topics that I mainly develop in collaboration with other researchers.

Currently, I am collaborating with [Dr. Luis Schiesari](http://lschiesari.wixsite.com/ecologia-aplicada) in one project exploring the effects of land use change on aquatic metacommunities and another project on the metacommunity structure of rock pools. I am also working with [Dr. David Rodriguez](http://drdz.wp.txstate.edu/) and his group on the distribution and genetics of _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ in Texas and with [Dr. Daniel Bolnick](https://bolnicklab.wordpress.com/) and his group on parasite infection and threespine stickleback gut microbiome.
