# About me

I am a PhD candidate in the [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior](https://cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program/) Graduate Program co-advised by Drs. [Mikhail Matz](https://matzlab.weebly.com/) and [Mathew Leibold](http://www.leiboldlab.com/). I started my career in biology as a herpetologist but rapidly became fascinated by the challenging questions in the field of ecology. During my bachelor’s and master’s thesis I studied the ecological and evolutionary aspects of amphibian metacommunities. For my PhD research I decided to change the scale of my study system, and I am now studying the community and metacommunity ecology of host-associated bacterial communities. Amphibians are still involved, but while before they were the organisms inhabiting different habitats, now I see them as the different habitats, and the bacteria inhabiting them are the organisms I am interested. By means of empirical and theoretical approaches, my ultimate goal is to apply and to adapt the ecological theory to the study of host-associated bacterial communities.
